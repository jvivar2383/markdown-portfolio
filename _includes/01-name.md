<h5>Data Scientist Candidate
  
 <p>
 Hi there! My name is Jenifer Vivar.

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and I'm currently working towards a Master's degree in data science. I am interested in telling stories using data. I spend my time learning new topics about machine learning and applying my knowledge to different projects that will soon be posted on my page.

As a former research scientist, I've found that exploratory analysis and using the data to build a narrative are the most exciting aspects of data science.

Projects I am currently working on include:

-Mixing Layer Height and its Effects on Pollutants during NYC's Heat Wave event. <br>
-Algorithm Optimization to Accurately measure Mixing Layer Height Levels using Doppler Lidar Technology.<br>
-Community College Learning outcomes in The Bronx.<br>
